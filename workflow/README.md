# Workflow

Ensure [cp8_cli](https://github.com/balvig/cp8_cli) is installed and up to date <img src="https://badge.fury.io/rb/cp8_cli.svg?style=flat" alt="Gem Version">

## Stories

1. `cp8 start <URL>` to start work on a GitHub issue
2. `cp8 start "Title of story"` to start an adhoc story
3. `cp8 open` to open associated WIP pull request
4. Remove [WIP] from title when ready for [code review](/code-review)
5. If necessary, [request and update translations](https://github.com/cookpad/global-web/blob/master/docs/operations.md#translations)
6. After completing code review merge in GitHub and _deploy_

**NOTE:** It is vital to deploy right after merging new code, so that _you_ can follow up on any bugs/issues, instead of it becoming the problem of the next person to deploy.

## Discussions and ideas around development

New ideas on how we can improve our development flow are always welcome!

- Avoid making proposals for new coding styles inside story-based PRs
- When proposing a change or new concept, submit an issue or isolated PR on GitHub
- Clearly show the before/after and any pain points that inspired the proposal
- Allow the issue or PR to sit long enough for everyone to have a look
